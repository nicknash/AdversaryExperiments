Adversary Experiments
---------------------

This project is a little experiment with some adversaries for sorting algorithms, or in fact any algorithm that is trying to extract a partial order from some data via repeated comparisons.

It's not useful for all that much, but it's a fun little toy anyway.

There's a detailed discussion at my blog:
